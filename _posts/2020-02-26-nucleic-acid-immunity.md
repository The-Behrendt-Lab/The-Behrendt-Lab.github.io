Over the last 20 years innate immune recognition of nucleic acids has been established as a central mechanism driving inflammation of sterile and of infectious etiologies. We investigate under which conditions endogenous nucleic acids can activate nucleic acid sensors of the innate immune system. Specifically, we identified molecular mechanisms that underly human conditions that are driven by aberrant signalling through the cGAS/STING DNA sensing pathway and we developed specific therapies targeting STING. In the future, we will investigate how immune recognition of endogenous viral sequences, which occupy around 40% of mammalian genomes, regulate immune responses in health and in disease.
